Step 1 (if necessary)
    Initialize node
        npm init -y

Step 2
    Install necessary packages
        sequelize@^5.0.0
        sequelize-cli^@5.0.0
        pg (pg version 8.6.0 or higher)

Step 3
    Initialize sequelize
        npx sequelize-cli init

Step 4
    Configure Sequelize
        Change username
            Change the user in postgres
        Change password
        Change Database name
        Change dialect to postgres
        "seederStorage": "sequelize"

Step 5
    Create database
        npx sequelize db:create
        npx sequelize db:drop (destroys database)

Step 6
    Create Tables (migrations/models)
    Migrations - Creating tables in the DB
    Models - Interact with tables for queries

    Migrations - ALWAYS PLURAL AND CAPITALIZED
    Models - Capitalized and Singular

    npx sequelize model:generate (generates a model and a matching migration)
