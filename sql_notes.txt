front end to back end

focusing more on back end stuff
    split into 2 parts:
        1) Database (this week)
        2) API Framework (handle requests, responses to front-end client)
            - wk 11 Express

Post-gres(sp?) - Postbird (need to download)

note: make w10 pull

Postgres terminal commands:

    psql - connect to postgres service
        (postgres needs to know targeted database and to know username in system)
        psql (databaseName) (username)

    \l - lists all databases
        : Name - Owner

    \du - lists all users

    \c database name: connects to the named database

    \dt - lists tables of current DB

    \d tablename - lists table details

    \q - close postgres

Steps to set up a DB for a project:

    1) Create a user
        CREATE USER username WITH attributes PASSWORD 'password'
            (must be in single quotes for password)

        note: cannot drop a user without dropping the database this controlled
            by said user first
        Drop commands:
            1 - DROP USER username;
            2 - DROP DATABASE databaseName;

    IMPORTANT - ALL SQL COMMANDS ARE ALL ENDED WITH A SEMICOLON

    2) Create the database
        CREATE DATABASE databaseName WITH OWNER username

    3) Create tables
        CREATE TABLE people (
            id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
            first_name VARCHAR(30),
            last_name VARCHAR(30),
            age SMALLINT
        )

    4) Insert data


Day 2 Notes

Numeric (x, x) - first number: number of digits, second number: scalor

Running a SQL file:
    psql -d boardgame_dev < path to file

Different types of relationships
    1) 1 - M : one to many -- board games to reviews
    2) 1 - 1 : one to one // won't build in a/A
    3) M - M : many to many

When inserting a new entry into a table
    after something was deleted,
    the next entry will have the ID
    of what as after the last
    deleted row.

When joining tables, ordering does matter.  May need to "link" things together if a table has no
    connection to another table.
